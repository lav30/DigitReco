# Kannada Handwritten Digit Recognizer

![Alt Text](kannadadigits.gif)


This project has focused on training a CNN model on handwritten Kannada digits and also on making predictions in real time using a GUI developed by [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app). Live predictions are made by drawing digits 0 to 9 in the Kannada language on the drawing pad and the trained model is utilised to make accurate predictions in real time.













Owing to the dataset size and limitations of web deployment , Heroku deployment is currently unavailable. However, local deployment is done using Gradio.
